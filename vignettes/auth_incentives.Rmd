# International co-authoring incentives in Norway

The aim of this project is to explore the impact of a change in how internatinal co-publishing is rewarded in the Norwegian academic publishing incentive system. It uses data collected from the Current Research Information System in Norway (CRIStin) database to examine whether a new policy change aimed at incentivising international collaboration has affected patterns of co-authorship among Norwegian researchers.
